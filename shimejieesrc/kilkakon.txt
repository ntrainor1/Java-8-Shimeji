Added premultiplying to the images so translucent images work now, yay!

Also did some regexing to the behaviour list so it looks nicer

1.0.5:

I did some basic changes to the program to make this new version. I did make an effort to contact
the original group but they didn't reply--so I'm releasing this as is, with full credit to them. :)

So cheers shimeji-ee group!

I may have accidentally pressed Alt+Shift+F in Netbeans in a few of the files because I can't stand 
if (...) { style brackets. Sorry if that offends anybody. :O

The main changes I made in this version:

- settings.properties instead of windows.txt and ActiveShimeji
- New form and renamed captions and reworked menus
- Not showing form on load
